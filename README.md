**a) Purpose of the Program(s):**
The purpose of the money program is to determine the amount of change needed and the minimum amount of each of the dollar denominations and coins needed for the transaction. The purpose of the temperature program is to convert between temperature scales using the formulas provided.

**b) Input:**
From what we learned in class, the program takes the following inputs: mouse, keyboard. 

**c) Expected Output:**
Also from what we learned in class, the program's output is the screen.

**d) Type of Execution:**
The type(s) of execution for the money and temperature program is the Sequential execution.

**e) Possible Improvements:**
The money program could be improved by:
Using repeated execution, these will save time for the user or users.
The tendered amount given could be increased to have a more balance change,
this will give a more clarifying data for how much change you can get using dollars and coins.

The temperature program could be improved by:
Adding a user input so that they user can input their own temperature to convert.
If there is a number that is very important I could add a constant to the program.
